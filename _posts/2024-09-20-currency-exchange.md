This Python program uses the ExchangeRate-API to convert currencies in real time. It fetches supported currencies and exchange rates, allowing users to input amounts for conversion.

### Key Features:
- Get a list of supported currencies
- Fetch real-time exchange rates
- Format currency amounts for better readability
- User-friendly interface for currency conversion

```python
def get_supported_currencies():
    """Get a list of supported currencies from the API."""
    # Implementation...

def get_exchange_rate(from_currency, to_currency):
    """Fetch real-time exchange rate between two currencies."""
    # Implementation...
```
